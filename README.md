# Iris Classifier
# Project Description
This project is a machine learning classifier built to identify the species of an iris flower based on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Four features are used to classify each flower:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
The model leverages supervised learning techniques to train on the provided data and accurately predict the species of the flower based on these features.

# Dataset
The dataset can be found here.
It contains 150 instances and is balanced with 50 samples for each of the three species.

# Workflow
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and inspected. Missing values (if any) are handled, and features are normalized if necessary.
Model Training: Various machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained using the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using cross-validation techniques.

# Technologies Used
Python: For implementing the classifier
Scikit-learn: For the machine learning algorithms
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization

# Results
The classifier achieves high accuracy on the test data, reliably distinguishing between the three species of Iris flowers based on the provided features.
